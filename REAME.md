## Variables

In Flutter, variables are used to store values. There are two types of variables in Flutter:

    - local variables: These are declared within a function and are only accessible within that function
    - Instance variables: They are declared within a class and are accessible throughout the entire class.

Variables in Flutter can store values of different data types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, and more.

## Built-in Types

There are several built-in data types, including:

    - int: used to store integers
    - double: used to store floating-point numbers
    - String: used to store text
    - bool: used to store true or false values
    - List: used to store ordered collections of objects
    - Sets: used to store unordered collection of unique items
    - Map: used to store unordered collections of key-value pairs

### Primitive Types

Numbers

Dart has three data types for holding numbers:

- num : The equivalent to the generic number type in JavaScript.
- int : A numeric value without a fractional part.
- double: Any 64-bit (double-precision) floating point number.

As Dart considers numbers as objects, numbers can expose their own utility functions as object methods. You don't need to use an additional object to apply a function to a number.
